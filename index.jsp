        <h2>Why Vaccination?</h2>
        <p>Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer, more reliable way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people by creating an immune response without the potentially severe illness or post-COVID conditions that can be associated with COVID-19 infection.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p> COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness.
Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.
None of the COVID-19 vaccines can give you COVID-19.
Bringing new vaccines to the public involves various steps, all which must be followed to ensure they are safe and effective before they are made available for use..</p>
